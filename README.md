# Assignment2
AUTHOR: Lisa Hanna

This is my final assignment 2.

DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT: For my final assignment, I decided to make a bank simulation.
In it, there are 3 different accounts. Both can do the same operations which are:
Print a bank statement, deposit money, withdraw money, transfer money between accounts, see future bank
values based on interest, and look for any other account from the same user in the bank.
I tried using as much of the knowledge that I have acquired over the semester in this project. 

ROUGH DIVISION OF TASKS: Obviously, as I am working alone, all I had to do was divide the task over a few days.
I started by creating all my classes and methods (or at least I thought I had put all of them at the time).
Then, I started working on the first account (since the procedure is the same for all 3 accounts, I focused on perfecting that one first).
Afterwards, when that was done, I just repeated the code for accounts 2 and 3 (adjusting them as I go).
On the last day, all that was left was to add some finishing touches (for example, adding an object for the date class
to add more knowledge from the semester into the project), and that was it!

CHALLENGE PROBLEM: I used two different challenges for this project. The first one was to withdraw money with the least amount of bills possible.
I didn't have that much trouble with this one, because in the past semester, I've done a similar exercise, so I knew I just need to use a combination
of the division (see how many times the biggest bill can fit) and remainder (see how much is left after
the first divisions) symbols. Therefore, I added another small challenge which did require some research, which is
the interest part of the bank. Adding interest as an extra feature was not difficult, what was difficult was to calculate
how much money would be in the bank in the future based on that interest. I have never done a calculation as such, so I did
need to do some research. In the end, I found that using the Math class would be most practical for this section.
